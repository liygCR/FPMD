# FPMD
'FPMD' is an 'R' package for the paper 'On Functional Processes with Multiple Discontinuities'.


## Installation
```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("liygCR/FPMD/FPMD")
```

## Description
This package handles the problem of estimating multiple discontinuities for a functional data process. A half-kernel approach is considered that addresses the inference of the total number, locations, and jump sizes of the changes in the mean function.
