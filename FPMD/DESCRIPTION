Title: On Functional Processes with Multiple Discontinuities
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jialiang Li, Yaguang Li and Tailen Hsing
Maintainer: Yaguang Li <liyg@ustc.edu.cn>
Description: This package handles the problem of estimating multiple discontinuities 
    for a functional data process. A half-kernel approach is considered that 
    addresses the inference of the total number, locations, and jump sizes of 
    the changes.
